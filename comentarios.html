        <span>Alex was a real pleasure to work with. I had a tricky</span>
        <span>situation with leaking downspout that needed to be</span>
        <span>repositioned. Alex responded to my Thumbtack request</span>
        <span>quickly, met with me the day, provided a proposal</span>
        <span>later that day and worked through a series of follow up</span>
        <span>questions. He even found a company to scope the</span>
        <span>downspout drains for me. The work itself was of excellent</span>
        <span>quality (he came and did the work himself).</span>

        <span>We couldn't be happier with our new gutters and highly</span>
        <span>recommend this company. Requested a quote online and</span>
        <span>Eugene called the same day. He was professional,</span>
        <span>knowledgeable, and easy to work with. You can tell he</span>
        <span>really cares about his customers and takes pride in giving</span>
        <span>you the best experience possible. He listened to our</span>
        <span>concerns, gave us some reommendations and made us</span>
        <span>feel comfortable throughout the whole process. It was an</span>
        <span>wasy decision fos us to choose Royal Gutters and you will</span>
        <span>be very pleased too!</span>
